## Testing
* This project was created using **test-driven development** (TDD).

* To view the test suite, open PLACEHOLDER

* To run the test suite yourself and verify program functionality

```bash
rspec
```

* If there is a problem in the code the testing suite will read as such :

<div>
  <img src="public/img/rspec-f2.PNG" alt="Failing RSpec test">
</div>

* Follow the examples and read the English that describes what the function should do. If everything is in order you should receive back :
<div>
  <img src="public/img/rspec-p.PNG" alt="Passing RSpec test">
</div>
